# Problem Definition
- How should we predict the attrition rate of employee based on workplace/personal factors?

# Motivation
In a competitive job landscape, what should companies do in order to retain talented or desirable workers?

# Models Used
1) Decision Tree
2) Random Forest Classifier


# Conclusion


# What did we learn from this project?
- Handling skewed datasets by using resampling from imblearn packages
- Random Forest Classifier using sklearn.ensemble package
- Using Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding to turn categorical data into integer format using sklearn.preprocessing package
- Using GitHub
- Using contingency Table for chi square test
- Using Chi Square test to find independence of variables to clean data using scipy package
- Converting categorical/numerical columns to a list
